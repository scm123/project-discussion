Role :
 Actually here we have already developed project.So we see the internal enhancement when encountered.
 We also see the customer bugs when comes to us.We check the exact behaviour of system and customer expectation.
 If its potential issue then we fix that and deliver.Some we also communicate with customer when there is some 
 critical issue with customer,we review their data at their end and verify the same behaviour internally .

We have ADF framework,

In which we have 4 layers-Model layer ,view layer ,controller layer and business service layer

•	The model layer represents the data values related to the current page
•	The view layer contains the UI pages used to view or modify that data.
•	The controller layer processes user input and determines page navigation.(Task flows)
•	The business service layer handles data access and encapsulates business logic.


When we create the UI page ,ADF creates one pageDefinition that have the all binding related information. When we add some component to it 
adf creates a data binding for it.When page is loaded then with help of binding it can get the value from the datacontrol.
